EXPERIMENT DESIGN-A-DOOR-BELL-PUSH-BUTTON

THEORY: 
As per the circuit diagram, we have made a circuit using and push button and resistor and the door bell. The door bell and the push button 
is connected to the Arduino using digital pins and digital port.
The push button reads the digital command and the Ardiuno tells the door bell about output using the code.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
As per the Arduino code, if the push button reads the high signal then the door bell gives high signal and if the button reads low signal 
then the bell gives low signal.


PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
You should take care whether the board in the arduino\uno or not and also selection of port in tools. This is the main problem where we
get confusion 

PRECAUTIONS: 
While installing bell in bread board we should take care whether the ’n’ terminals is connected or not.Here the ‘n’ terminals 
should be connected similarly, we should check whether the ‘p’ terminals are connected or not.In this case ‘p’ terminals should not be
connected . 
Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.  

LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
With this experiment we can learn that how door bell rings if it gets the command from the push button.
