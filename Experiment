EXPERIMENT DESIGN-A-DOOR-BELL-PUSH-BUTTON

THEORY: 
As per the circuit diagram, we have made a circuit using and push button and resistor and the door bell. The door bell and the push button 
is connected to the Arduino using digital pins and digital port.
The push button reads the digital command and the Ardiuno tells the door bell about output using the code.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
As per the Arduino code, if the analog value falls below 400 we consider it as dark and the light turns ON. If the value comes above 400 
we consider it as bright and the light turns OFF. 


PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
You should take care whether the board in the arduino\uno or not and also selection of port in tools. This is the main problem where we
get confusion 

PRECAUTIONS: 
While installing led’s in bread board we should take care whether the ’n’ terminals of LDR is connected or not.Here the ‘n’ terminals 
should be connected similarly, we should check whether the ‘p’ terminals are connected or not.In this case ‘p’ terminals should not be
connected . 
Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.  

LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
With this experiment we can learn that how LED start glowing when its dark and LED is off when its in sunlight.
